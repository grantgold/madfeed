			<h1>About MAD</h1>
			<p>Founded in 2011, MAD is a not-for-profit organization that 
			aims to build a community of cooks, purveyors, and thinkers 
			with an appetite for knowledge and a desire to improve the 
			restaurant trade. The cornerstone of MAD is an annual symposium, 
			held every summer, that brings 600 people into a circus tent 
			along Copenhagen's harbor and features two days of talks from 
			speakers from around the world. All videos of the talks are 
			viewable online, for free.</p>
