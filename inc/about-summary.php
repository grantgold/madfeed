				<h1>About MAD</h1>
				<p><u>MAD</u> (taken from the Danish word for “food”) is a not-for-pro&#xFB01;t organization that works to expand knowledge of food to make every meal a better meal; not just at restaurants, but every meal cooked and served. Good cooking and a healthy environment can and should go hand-in-hand, and the quest for a better meal can leave the world a better place than we found it.
	MAD is committed to producing and sharing this knowledge and to taking promising ideas from theory to practice.</p>
