							Chefs Daniel Patterson and Roy Choi have announced the first location of their 
							fast food concept loco’l: it’ll be at 57 Taylor Street, in the Tenderloin neighborhood 
							of San Francisco, one of the most dangerous areas of the city. They promise a late 
							spring/early summer opening date.

							Choi and Patterson announced the project at MAD over the summer. In a statement 
							published on this site in August, Patterson explained, “I needed to start a business 
							that could grow quickly and supplant the fast-food chains and convenience stores that 
							separate our youth from the taste of real food. I envisioned a new kind of fast-food 
							restaurant that served real food in a nice environment, and which could contribute to 
							the neighborhood around it in myriad ways. My answer lay to the south, in Los Angeles, 
							where Roy Choi was bringing people together from all over the city around Kogi—food 
							trucks that served tasty, hard-to-categorize food.” You can read Patterson’s complete 
							thoughts on the genesis of loco’l here.

							<br>

							Choi was a crucial inspiration for the project: at MAD3, he spoke of hunger, food 
							deserts, and the need for high-end chefs to reach people that don’t get to try their 
							restaurants. It is one of the most popular talks in the history of MAD.
