The MAD Feed is a community for chefs, cooks, and farmers to learn more about food from around the world. It is a resource of food literature, lectures, and video archives from the MAD Symposiums, MAD Mondays, and daily editorial from the staff of MAD, the Nordic Food Lab, and knowledgeable food world luminaries.

The site is designed and maintained by Grant Gold in partnership with MAD.
