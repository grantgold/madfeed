        <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-9 col-sm-offset-3 medium-top-btm-padding about-medium">Sitting at the intersection of cooking, culture, science, policy, and food production, MAD’s vision is to create an interdisciplinary conversation about sustainability and deliciousness. Embracing the forces that power today's most influential restaurants—creativity, collaboration, research, and innovation—MAD serves as an international platform for talking and thinking about topics at the forefront of cooking. From inspiring collaboration between chefs, producers, and academics to performing research into various culinary questions; MAD is a place where new knowledge is produced and shared without restrictions, and with the commitment to taking promising ideas from theory and put them into practice.
        <br><br>We believe that a wider application of this interdisciplinary discourse in cooking can be the key to a more sustainable, healthy, delicious and bio-diverse future; not just for restaurants and producers, but for every meal cooked and served.</div>
