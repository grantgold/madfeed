        <div class="col-xs-8 medium-top-btm-padding about-medium">Sitting at the intersection of cooking, culture, science, policy, and food production, MAD’s vision is to create an interdisciplinary conversation about sustainability and deliciousness. <i>Embracing the forces that power today's most influential restaurants—creativity, collaboration, research, and innovation—MAD serves as an international platform for talking and thinking about topics at the forefront of cooking.</i> From inspiring collaboration between chefs, producers, and academics to performing research into various culinary questions; <b>MAD is a place where new knowledge is produced and shared without restrictions, and with the commitment to taking promising ideas from theory and put them into practice.</b>
        <br><br>We believe that a wider application of this interdisciplinary discourse in cooking can be the key to a more sustainable, healthy, delicious and bio-diverse future; not just for restaurants and producers, but for every meal cooked and served.</div>
